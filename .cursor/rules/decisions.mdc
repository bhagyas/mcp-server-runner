# UI Layout Decisions

1. Navigation Structure
   - Sidebar with "Servers" and "Settings" navigation items
   - Main content area for displaying server list and settings

2. Panel and Modal Behaviors
   - Add/Edit Server form: Slides in from the right as a side panel
   - Terminal: Slides up from the bottom
   - Configuration Editor: Centered popup modal (90% viewport size with max dimensions)

3. Button Placement
   - "Add Server" and "Edit Configuration" as separate buttons in header
   - "Add Server" opens side panel
   - "Edit Configuration" opens modal popup

4. Visual Design
   - Replaced emojis with VS Code icons from react-icons/vsc
   - Set minimum font size to system default (1rem) for better readability
   - Used consistent padding and spacing throughout
   - Implemented proper z-index layering for overlays

5. Component Styling
   - Side panel: 450px width, full height
   - Config Editor Modal: 90% viewport width/height (max 1200px/800px)
   - Terminal: Full width, dynamic height from bottom

6. State Management
   - Separate state controls for Add Server panel and Config Editor
   - Independent open/close functionality for each panel
