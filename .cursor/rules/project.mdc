This is built with Tauri.

I want to build an app that runs in the background of macOS.
It should have a mac menu bar item to show that its running.

The application lets you add commands such as 'npx @agentdeskai/browser-tools-server@latest' that run a particular server.

- Always add the crates if required or missing.
- It is built with tauri, so Typescript and Rust.
- This uses tauri 2.0, NOT 1.x
- Use the tauri documentation from https://v2.tauri.app/
